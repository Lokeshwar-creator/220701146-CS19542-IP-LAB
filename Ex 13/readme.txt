Program to develop an attractive web pages using ReactJS.


To develop an attractive web page using ReactJS, let's build a simple multi-page layout with a navigation bar, home page, about page, and a contact form. This layout will incorporate basic UI styling with CSS and the React Router for navigation.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up and code the project:


1. Project Setup
Install Node.js if you haven’t already. You can download it from Node.js official website.

Create a new React project using the following command:
npx create-react-app attractive-webpage


Navigate into your project directory:
cd attractive-webpage


Install React Router for multi-page navigation:
npm install react-router-dom


2. File Structure
Your project structure should look like this after you create additional component files:
attractive-webpage/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Navbar.js
